#######################################
Welcome to Sortium's Documentation
#######################################

**Sortium** is a high-performance, parallelized Python utility designed for rapidly organizing file systems. It leverages multiple CPU cores to sort thousands of files into clean, categorized directories based on type, modification date, or custom regex patterns.

Designed for both speed and safety, it is memory-efficient for handling massive directories and automatically prevents file overwrites.

Core Features
-------------

*   **High-Performance Parallel Processing**: Utilizes a ``ProcessPoolExecutor`` to dramatically speed up file moving and organization, especially in large directories.

*   **Versatile Sorting Logic**:
    *   **By Type**: Organize files into categories like ``Images``, ``Documents``, ``Archives``, etc.
    *   **By Date**: Further organize categorized files into date-stamped folders (e.g., ``01-Jan-2023``).
    *   **By Regex**: Use powerful, custom regex patterns to categorize files recursively.

*   **Safe and Controlled Operations**:
    *   Automatically handles file name collisions to prevent accidental data loss.
    *   Sort files in-place or move them to a completely separate destination directory.

*   **Memory-Efficient Design**: Employs generators to process files one by one, ensuring a tiny memory footprint even with millions of files.

A 30-Second Guide
-----------------

.. warning::

   **Always back up your files before running Sortium.**
   This utility performs file move operations that modify your directory structure. Misuse could lead to data loss.

First, install the library via pip:

.. code-block:: console

   pip install sortium


**Example 1: Basic Sorting by Type (In-Place)**

This is the simplest use case. It organizes all files in a folder into subdirectories like ``Images``, ``Documents``, and ``Videos``.

.. code-block:: python

   from sortium.sorter import Sorter

   # The folder you want to clean up
   my_folder = "/path/to/my_messy_downloads"

   # Create a Sorter instance and run the sort
   sorter = Sorter()
   sorter.sort_by_type(my_folder)


**Example 2: Sorting to a New Destination**

Organize files from a source folder and move the categorized results to a separate, clean location.

.. code-block:: python

   from sortium.sorter import Sorter

   source_dir = "/path/to/source_files"
   destination_dir = "/path/to/organized_archive"

   sorter = Sorter()

   # Files from source_dir will be moved to categorized folders inside destination_dir
   sorter.sort_by_type(source_dir, dest_folder_path=destination_dir)


**Example 3: Advanced Sorting with Regex**

Recursively scan a directory and sort files based on custom patterns. This is great for organizing project files, logs, or datasets.

.. code-block:: python

   from sortium.sorter import Sorter

   project_folder = "/path/to/data_science_project"
   sorted_output = "/path/to/sorted_project_files"

   # Define categories and their corresponding regex patterns
   regex_patterns = {
       "Datasets": r".*\.csv$",
       "Notebooks": r".*\.ipynb$",
       "Final_Reports": r"final_report_.*\.pdf$"
   }

   sorter = Sorter()
   sorter.sort_by_regex(project_folder, regex_patterns, sorted_output)
